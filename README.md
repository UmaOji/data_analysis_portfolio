## Portfolio Projects
###
Here, I'll showcase data analytics projects, providing an overview of the technical solutions implemented.
## CSR Spending and Beneficiaries: Nigerian Banks
This dataset contains information on corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending by major Nigerian banks, including Zenith Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank (GT Bank), First Bank of Nigeria, Ecobank Nigeria, Wema Bank, Access Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Diamond Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria, and Fidelity Bank. The dataset tracks quarterly CSR expenditures (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) and the number of beneficiaries impacted by these initiatives over several years.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data Analysis, Correlation Analysis, Data Visualization
- **Technology:** Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Markdown
- **Results:** A correlation analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between CSR spending and the number of beneficiaries, with a correlation coefficient of **0.791**. This suggests that higher CSR investments are generally associated with a greater impact on beneficiaries. The results support the hypothesis that increased spending by banks tends to lead to larger numbers of beneficiaries served by CSR programs.
